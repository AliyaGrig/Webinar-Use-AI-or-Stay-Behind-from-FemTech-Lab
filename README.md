Rachael Dovey and I discussed their respective #products and how they used AI to solve specific problems. This was an excellent opportunity to gain insights into how AI can be used to improve health outcomes and address the unique challenges faced by #womenshealth #startups.

Generative AI had been a hot topic in the last 6 months, and Martin Raison provided an introduction to this exciting technology and the new opportunities it created for entrepreneurs and builders in women's health. The discussion was then opened up to everyone.
